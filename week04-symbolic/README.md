# Inductive Logic Programming

## Objectives
- Deepen your understanding of learning from logical representations.
- Explore background knowledge, coverage, and hypothesis space.
- Study key ILP algorithms and use real ILP systems.

## Readings
- *Inductive Logic Programming: Techniques and Applications* – Muggleton & De Raedt.
- "Introduction to ILP" – Stephen Muggleton (1995).
- *Foundations of Inductive Logic Programming* – Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer.

## Practice
- Install and run the Aleph ILP system with Prolog.
- Use a simple dataset to induce logical rules.
- Analyze the coverage and accuracy of learned hypotheses.

## Notes
- Capture insights on hypothesis evaluation and logic programming constraints.
- Consider domains where ILP might outperform sub-symbolic methods.
