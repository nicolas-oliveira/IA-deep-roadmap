# Symbolic Learning

## Objectives
- Learn how symbolic systems perform generalization from examples.
- Understand decision trees, ILP, and knowledge-based learning.
- Explore the relationship between logic and machine learning.

## Readings
- *Machine Learning* (Tom Mitchell), Chapter 3 – Decision Trees.
- "Symbolic Machine Learning: A Guide" – Pat Langley.
- Research on FOIL and ID3/C4.5 algorithms.

## Practice
- Implement the ID3 decision tree algorithm.
- Use the `scikit-learn` DecisionTreeClassifier and extract rules.
- Try an open-source ILP system like Aleph or TILDE.

## Notes
- Reflect on the strengths and limitations of symbolic learning.
- Note the inductive bias required for learning logical rules.
