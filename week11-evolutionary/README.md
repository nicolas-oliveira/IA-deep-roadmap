# Metaheuristics

## Objectives
- Study global optimization strategies: Simulated Annealing, PSO, ACO.
- Understand landscapes, local optima, and stochastic search.
- Compare metaheuristics to traditional ML optimization.

## Readings
- *Essentials of Metaheuristics* – Sean Luke (Free eBook).
- "A Brief Review of Metaheuristics" – Talbi (2015).
- Tutorials on PySwarm and Simulated Annealing in SciPy.

## Practice
- Solve a TSP-like problem using PSO or ACO.
- Compare results with a genetic algorithm.
- Analyze performance on noisy or deceptive landscapes.

## Notes
- Describe differences in exploration mechanisms.
- Note convergence behaviors and randomization roles.
