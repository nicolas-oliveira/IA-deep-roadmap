# Foundations of Symbolic AI

## Objectives

- Understand the historical context and theoretical foundations of Symbolic Artificial Intelligence.
- Explore key concepts such as knowledge representation, logic-based reasoning, and expert systems.
- Reflect on the strengths and limitations of symbolic approaches, and how they relate to modern developments in AI.

## Readings

### Core

- **"Symbolic Behaviour in Artificial Intelligence"** – McGregor et al. (2021)  
  [arXiv:2102.03406](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03406)  
  This article examines the foundations of symbolic behavior in AI, offering a conceptual overview of symbolic reasoning systems.

- **"Knowledge Representation"** – Chapter from *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by Russell & Norvig  
  Focus on logic, rule-based systems, and the structure of symbolic knowledge.

### Supplementary

- **"Neuro-Symbolic AI in 2024: A Systematic Review"** – Stammer et al. (2024)  
  [arXiv:2501.05435](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05435)  
  A comprehensive review that provides context on how symbolic systems are currently being integrated with neural architectures.

- **"The History of Artificial Intelligence"** – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  
  A broader philosophical and historical context to situate Symbolic AI in the development of the field.

## Practice

- Design a simple rule-based expert system using Python (e.g., for medical diagnosis or troubleshooting).
- Write propositional and first-order logic expressions for real-world scenarios (e.g., family trees, scheduling).
- Explore the CLIPS or Prolog environment for symbolic reasoning examples.

## Notes

- Symbolic AI was the dominant paradigm until the 1980s, centered on manually encoded rules and formal logic.
- Its limitations in handling ambiguity, learning from data, and scalability opened the way for sub-symbolic approaches like neural networks.
- Despite this, symbolic reasoning remains vital in domains requiring explainability and structured knowledge.
- Hybrid approaches—neuro-symbolic systems—are at the frontier of AI research today.
