# Foundations of Symbolic AI

## Objectives
- Understand the core principles of Symbolic AI.
- Study the historical context and evolution of symbolic reasoning.
- Explore production systems, rule-based systems, and symbolic search algorithms.

## Readings
- *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* (Russell & Norvig), Chapters 1–2 and 10.
- "A Review of Symbolic Artificial Intelligence" – Joseph et al. (2021) [arXiv:2104.00706].
- [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy – Artificial Intelligence](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/artificial-intelligence/)

## Practice
- Implement a simple rule-based expert system in Python.
- Solve a symbolic search problem using depth-first and breadth-first strategies.
- Optional: Use CLIPS or Prolog to explore logic programming basics.

## Notes
- Summarize the differences between symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches.
- Reflect on where symbolic reasoning is still used in modern AI systems.
