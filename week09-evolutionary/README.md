# Genetic Algorithms

## Objectives
- Understand selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness functions.
- Explore population-based search and convergence.
- Study schema theory and building blocks.

## Readings
- *An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms* – Melanie Mitchell.
- "Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning" – David E. Goldberg.
- Intro tutorials on DEAP or PyGAD libraries.

## Practice
- Implement a GA to solve a numerical optimization problem.
- Use DEAP or PyGAD to evolve solutions to the knapsack problem.
- Visualize convergence of fitness scores over generations.

## Notes
- Reflect on the balance between exploration and exploitation.
- Write about GA parameters and their effects.
