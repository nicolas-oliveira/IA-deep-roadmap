# Neuroevolution

## Objectives
- Combine evolutionary algorithms with neural networks.
- Study NEAT, HyperNEAT, and evolutionary strategies (ES).
- Explore automated architecture discovery and training.

## Readings
- "Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies" – Stanley & Miikkulainen.
- OpenAI ES blog & paper.
- "A Survey on Neuroevolution" – Floreano et al. (2008).

## Practice
- Use NEAT-Python to evolve controllers or networks.
- Compare evolved networks to backprop-trained ones.
- Evolve network topologies for reinforcement learning tasks.

## Notes
- Reflect on the potential and scalability of neuroevolution.
- Note applications in architecture search and robotics.
