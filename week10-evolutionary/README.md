# Genetic Programming

## Objectives
- Learn how programs can be evolved.
- Understand tree-based representations and program mutation.
- Explore symbolic regression and function discovery.

## Readings
- *Genetic Programming: On the Programming of Computers by Means of Natural Selection* – Koza.
- DEAP documentation: GP module.
- "A Field Guide to Genetic Programming" – Poli, Langdon, McPhee.

## Practice
- Evolve symbolic expressions to fit data (symbolic regression).
- Use DEAP’s GP module for expression evolution.
- Try evolving mathematical functions to match datasets.

## Notes
- Capture insights into tree representation and crossover/mutation challenges.
- Reflect on overfitting in genetic programming.
