# Automated Inference

## Objectives
- Study propositional and first-order logic.
- Understand forward and backward chaining.
- Learn about resolution-based theorem proving.

## Readings
- *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*, Chapters 7–9.
- "A Survey of Automated Deduction" – John Alan Robinson.
- "Logic for Computer Science" – Steve Reeves (Ch. 2–4).

## Practice
- Implement forward and backward chaining in Python.
- Use a resolution theorem prover (e.g., Pyke or Prover9).
- Explore satisfiability solvers (e.g., Z3 SMT Solver).

## Notes
- Compare chaining methods and describe when each is appropriate.
- Annotate your understanding of Horn clauses and unification.
