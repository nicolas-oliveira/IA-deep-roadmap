# CNNs and RNNs

## Objectives
- Study convolutional layers, pooling, and temporal modeling.
- Understand sequence modeling with RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs.
- Learn how CNNs apply to images and RNNs to text/time-series.

## Readings
- *Deep Learning* – Goodfellow, Chapters 9 and 10.
- "Long Short-Term Memory" – Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997).
- "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Networks" – Krizhevsky et al. (2012).

## Practice
- Build a CNN for image classification using a small dataset.
- Train an RNN for sequence prediction (e.g., character-level language modeling).
- Visualize filters and activations from CNN layers.

## Notes
- Note differences in inductive bias between CNNs and RNNs.
- Reflect on the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs.
